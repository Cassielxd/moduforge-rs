## Quick Start

ModuForge-RS is a Rust-based state management and data transformation framework focusing on immutable data structures and event-driven architecture. It provides a business-agnostic editor core implementation that can be customized and extended to support the needs of any business scenario.

### How ModuForge Works

- **model**: Defines basic data including Nodes, Marks, Schemas, etc.
- **state**: Manages state, primarily responsible for state updates and plugin scheduling.
- **transform**: Implements transactions similar to database transactions, ensuring atomicity and data consistency.
- **core**: Combines model, state, and transform to implement core runtime functionality.
- **rules**: Rule engine system including expression parsing, backend execution, and template system.

### Core Features

#### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Components**

- **Async Processor**: High-performance async task processing
- **Event System**: Type-safe event dispatch and handling
- **Extension Mechanism**: Flexible plugin and extension loading
- **Middleware Support**: Configurable request/response pipeline
- **Flow Control**: Sync and async flow management

#### üìä **Data Model**

- **Node System**: Hierarchical document node structure
- **Mark System**: Document formatting and attribute marking
- **Attribute System**: Type-safe property management
- **Schema Definition**: Document structure validation
- **Content Matching**: Smart content validation and matching

#### üîÑ **State Management**

- **Immutable State**: Persistent data structures based on im-rs
- **Transaction Processing**: ACID-compatible transaction system
- **Resource Management**: Global resource table and lifecycle management
- **Plugin System**: Dynamic plugin loading with state isolation
- **Logging System**: Structured logging and performance monitoring
