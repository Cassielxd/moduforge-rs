    class RESOURCE resource
    class STATEFIELD statefield
    class PLUGINTRAIT plugintrait
```

### Event-Driven Architecture

The event system is one of the core features of ModuForge-RS, providing decoupled communication mechanisms:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Runtime
    participant EventBus
    participant Plugin1
    participant Plugin2
    participant Storage

    Client->>Runtime: Submit Operation
    Runtime->>EventBus: Publish Event
    EventBus->>Plugin1: Notify Plugin1
    EventBus->>Plugin2: Notify Plugin2
    EventBus->>Storage: Persist Event
    Plugin1-->>EventBus: Processing Complete
    Plugin2-->>EventBus: Processing Complete
    EventBus-->>Runtime: All Processing Complete
    Runtime-->>Client: Return Result
```

## Core Components Detailed

### 1. Async Runtime (AsyncRuntime)

The async runtime is the execution core of the entire framework, providing:

- **High-performance async processing**: Async task scheduling based on Tokio
- **Middleware pipeline**: Configurable request/response processing chain
- **Timeout mechanisms**: Comprehensive timeout protection and error handling
- **Performance monitoring**: Built-in performance metrics collection and analysis

```rust
// Create async runtime
let mut runtime = ForgeAsyncRuntime::create(options).await?;

// Configure performance monitoring
runtime.set_performance_config(PerformanceConfig {
    enable_monitoring: true,
    middleware_timeout_ms: 1000,
    task_receive_timeout_ms: 5000,
    ..Default::default()
});

// Execute command
runtime.command(Arc::new(MyCommand)).await?;
```

### 2. State Management System (State)

The state management system is responsible for maintaining the overall application state:

- **Immutable state**: Persistent data structures based on `im-rs`
- **Version control**: Automatic version tracking and state snapshots
- **Plugin state**: Isolated plugin state management
- **Transaction support**: ACID-compatible state changes

```rust
// Create state
let state = State::create(StateConfig {
    schema: Some(schema),
    plugins: Some(plugins),
    ..Default::default()
}).await?;

// Apply transaction
let mut transaction = Transaction::new();
transaction.add_step(AddNodeStep::new(node, parent_id));
let result = state.apply(transaction).await?;
```

### 3. Rules Engine System

The rules engine provides powerful business rule processing capabilities:

- **GoRules JDM compatibility**: Based on standard decision models
- **High-performance expressions**: Compiled expression evaluation
- **Decision graph execution**: Execution of complex decision flows
- **Custom functions**: Support for user-defined extension functions

```rust
// Create decision engine
let engine = DecisionEngine::new(FilesystemLoader::new(options));

// Execute decision
let context = json!({ "age": 25, "income": 50000 });
let result = engine.evaluate("loan_approval.json", &context).await?;
```

### 4. Collaboration System

The collaboration system supports real-time multi-user collaboration:

- **CRDT synchronization**: Conflict-free replicated data types based on Yrs
- **WebSocket communication**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Room management**: Multi-room isolated collaboration environment
- **Conflict resolution**: Automatic conflict detection and resolution

```rust
// Start collaboration service
let server = CollaborationServer::new(config);
server.start().await?;

// Create collaboration room
let room = sync_service.create_room("room_id").await?;
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Plugin Development Best Practices

```rust
// Recommended plugin architecture
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyPluginResource {
    data: HashMap<String, Value>,
}

impl Resource for MyPluginResource {
    fn as_any(&self) -> &dyn Any { self }
    fn as_any_mut(&mut self) -> &mut dyn Any { self }
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyStateField;

#[async_trait]
impl StateField for MyStateField {
    async fn init(&self, _: &StateConfig, _: Option<&State>) -> Arc<dyn Resource> {
        Arc::new(MyPluginResource {
            data: HashMap::new(),
        })
    }
    
    async fn apply(&self, tr: &Transaction, value: Arc<dyn Resource>, 
                   _: &State, _: &State) -> Arc<dyn Resource> {
        // State update logic
        value
    }
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyPluginTrait;

#[async_trait]
impl PluginTrait for MyPluginTrait {
    async fn append_transaction(&self, _: &[Transaction], _: &State, 
                               _: &State) -> StateResult<Option<Transaction>> {
        // Plugin business logic
        Ok(None)
    }
}
```

### 2. Performance Optimization Recommendations

- **Batch operations**: Use batch transactions to reduce state update frequency
- **Caching strategies**: Use caching appropriately to improve query performance
- **Async processing**: Make full use of async capabilities for improved concurrency
- **Memory optimization**: Release unnecessary resources promptly

### 3. Error Handling Patterns

```rust
// Use Result type for error handling
pub type ForgeResult<T> = Result<T, ForgeError>;

// Custom error types
#[derive(thiserror::Error, Debug)]
pub enum ForgeError {
    #[error("State error: {0}")]
    StateError(String),
    
    #[error("Transaction error: {0}")]
    TransactionError(String),
    
    #[error("Plugin error: {0}")]
    PluginError(String),
}
```
