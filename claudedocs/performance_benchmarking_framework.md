# ModuForge-RS Performance Benchmarking Framework

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive performance benchmarking strategy for the ModuForge-RS framework. The strategy addresses 14 core crates with systematic benchmarking, regression detection, and automated performance validation.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Benchmarks
- **Expression Crate**: Complete benchmark suite (lexer, standard parsing, unary operations, isolate execution)
- **Engine Crate**: Basic benchmarks (loader, decision evaluation)
- **Infrastructure**: Criterion.rs with async support, workspace-wide configuration

### Performance-Critical Gaps
- **Core Runtime**: No benchmarks for async runtime, event system, middleware pipeline
- **State Management**: No benchmarks for transaction processing, plugin system
